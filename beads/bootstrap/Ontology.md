# Ontology (Bootstrap Bead)

Type: Concept × Long-term

This bead describes the core ontology used by Taconem.

Taconem uses a 2×2×2 model for beads along three axes:

1. **Conceptual vs Schematic**
   - Conceptual: ideas, components, capabilities, explanations.
   - Schematic: formal contracts, APIs, specifications, data schemas.

2. **Short-term vs Long-term**
   - Short-term: created to support current work; may be deleted later.
   - Long-term: stable, persistent, and candidates for embeddings.

3. **Task vs Concept**
   - Task: action to be performed; can be completed and retired.
   - Concept: enduring structures, definitions, or capabilities.

In practice, Taconem emphasizes three bins:

- Short-term, Conceptual, Task        → ephemeral work descriptions.
- Long-term, Conceptual, Concept      → persistent descriptions of system pieces.
- Long-term, Schematic, Concept       → specs and contracts (e.g., API definitions).

This ontology guides how new beads should be created and categorized.
